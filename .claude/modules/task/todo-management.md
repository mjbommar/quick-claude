# Task Management with TodoWrite

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Use TodoWrite Tool PROACTIVELY

**You MUST use the TodoWrite tool to track all tasks:**
- Create todos for multi-step work
- Mark as `in_progress` when starting
- Mark as `completed` immediately when done
- Only one task `in_progress` at a time

## Task States

- `pending`: Not yet started
- `in_progress`: Currently working (limit 1)
- `completed`: Finished successfully

## When to Use Todos

Create todos when:
- Task has 3+ steps
- Working on complex features
- User provides multiple tasks
- Debugging multiple issues

## Task Breakdown

Good task decomposition:
- Specific, actionable items
- Measurable completion criteria
- Logical ordering
- Clear dependencies

## Example Workflow

```
1. Create todo list for feature
2. Mark first task in_progress
3. Complete implementation
4. Mark completed, start next
5. Continue until all done
```

## Best Practices

- Update status in real-time
- Never batch status updates
- Include context in descriptions
- Remove irrelevant tasks
- Add new tasks as discovered
